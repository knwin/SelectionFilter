# SelectionFilter
 You know what you want to show from the layer visually and it is tedious work to write a query syntax for too many features.

 This plugin will allow you to select features and then make a filter on the layer to show just selected features.
 
 It use a user selected field to use in the filter. If the field is with unique values, the exact selected features will be shown. If the field has duplicated values, then the result will include features that you do not selected.

 You can reset the field anytime.

Menus can be found in the layer's right click popup as follow
 - **Show selected features only** - set filter for selected features
 - **Clear filter** - remove the filter
 - **Set field** - to choose a field to use in the filter

about=This plugin will show only the selected feature using filter query. Menus are in the layer's right click popup menus. The field selected and  its values for the selected features are used in query syntax. If you want to show only selected features, set a field with unique values. If the field has duplicate values (e.g parent field), some other features which are not selected will be in the filtered result.

  MENUs:
  Show selected features only - set filter for selected features
  Clear filter - remove the filter
  Set field - to choose a field to use in the filter
